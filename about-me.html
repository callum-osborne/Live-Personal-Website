                            a wide variety of skills, this includes; coding, time management, agile development, Linux and working in a team. As part of the team I will be using software and tools that are used on wide scale servers, for example; Prometheus,
                            Grafana, OpenStack and Docker. Throughout my time in Silicon Valley I will be attending technology events frequently like Hackathons and talks, this will allow me to grow my network and meet a lot of new people while also improving
                            my technical skills. I also plan to complete the CCNA Routing and Switching certification, this will be a good way to verify my networking and hardware knowledge.<br></p>

                            with hardware&nbsp;and software faults. I split my time in the technology department looking at the&nbsp;different teams such as the storage and platforms team (Windows, Linux...) but&nbsp;mainly focusing on the software development
                            and networking team. I learnt a lot&nbsp;about how small agile software teams are used within the met office and how they&nbsp;are developing software in the cloud using Amazons AWS proving to me why it is&nbsp;beneficial.
                            I also learnt a lot of networking skills using high grade networking Cisco&nbsp;hardware, being given the opportunity to setup my own network systems.<br></p>

                            where I learnt about all the different methods of software development and the laws around computing (68%), discrete mathematics for computation which contains mathematical methods used throughout the computing course (85%,
                            84%), computer architecture, programming (C &amp; Java), visual computing, machine learning, AI, comparing programming languages and, data structures &amp; algorithms…<br><br>In a piece of my programming coursework worth 25%
                            of the second programming module I received 90.91%, the coursework was to create a chat system that could have multiple clients connect to a single server and communicate with each other using techniques like networking, threading

                            language Pascal, then examined on it in an on-screen exam, we also had a written theory exam then coursework, all weighing equally. For my coursework I used C# to create a simulator of a processor, simulating the execution
                            of assembly instructions that would alter registers and allow the user to see them change in real time as it stepped through the instructions. I received 98% in this coursework, dropping only 2 marks.<br></p>

                            <h3>Confident Programming Languages</h3>
                            <p class="text-muted">After learning Pascal at College, I was examined on it by being given a program written in the language beforehand where we had to study the code then, during the exam we were tasked to add features and add fixes to the code.
                                For the coursework I decided to use C# to create a simulation of a running processor and allow the user to program their own commands and have it simulate the processor running.<br>At university I had modules that taught
                                us how to use C and Java, we were given multiple pieces of coursework that would test our knowledge and understanding of the languages.<br>In our visual computing module, we had to learn MATLAB for our larger piece of
                                coursework. In the machine learning and AI modules we used Python to deal with large quantities of data. During my internship at Cisco I have used a lot of Python and Go. And for my own personal projects,
                                I have used; JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Python.<br></p>
                            <h3>Linux Systems and Servers</h3>
                            <p class="text-muted">Currently I have two servers hosted in my home in the UK, one is a raspberry pi zero that runs a backup OpenVPN server allowing me to connect to my network in case my second server dies. The second is a tower PC that runs
                                VMWare ESXi, this hosts multiple virtual machines, for example an OpenVPN VM, a storage VM, webserver VM and Ubuntu Server VM running PLEX. The virtual machines allowed me to have greater redundancy while I am away from
                                home while also allowing me to create snapshots of the states and restore if there are any changes that cause problems. While on my Cisco Internship I am working with Linux servers running systems like Docker and Kubernetes,
                                this has allowed me to get confident with these systems.</p>
                            <h3>Networking</h3>
                            <p class="text-muted">I learnt basic networking protocols in my IT lessons while in secondary school, like HTTP, TCP and UDP. This was expanded on when I started College and took Computer Science classes, allowing me to understand the fundamentals
                                of parallel and series protocols and how they pass information while also learning about the different hardware that is used to connect the different devices in different topologies.&nbsp;<br>When I started university,
                                I took a networking class, this allowed me to get a deeper understanding which was used within my summer internship at The Met Office. This team was tasked to keep the current large network
                                of sub stations around the globe connected and to improve it to keep with the ever-changing speed of throughput on the network. During my time there I learnt to setup my own network using Cisco switches and routers and understanding
                                about different ways of connecting them securely.<br></p>
                            <h3>Time Management</h3>
                            <p class="text-muted" id="hobbies">I have had two part times jobs while studying, one was as a waiter at The Bishop Lacey in Chudleigh, Devon. I started this when I was 15 years old and required me to be punctual while also improving my interpersonal skills
                                with customers, I worked there for a year before moving away. I then worked while studying at Exeter College on the weekends at the retail store Debenhams, this also required me to be punctual and my manager was happy with
                                my progress and allowed me to transfer to the store in Bath to continue working for the company during my first year of my Degree at The University of Bath. These Jobs allowed me to understand the importance of being on
                                time and making sure I manage my time well.</p>

                    <p class="text-center text-muted">I have fought for my university twice in the British University and Colleges Sport (BUCS) tournament in Judo in which I received a silver and bronze medal. In my first year it was special achievement as I was the only first year to
                        medal, it took a lot of training both in the gym and on the mat staying highly committed to a strict routine. Other activities would include the administration of a VMWare Linux server running virtual machines containing a personal
                        file cloud, OpenVPN and plex media server. I also have some personal projects including a python Spotify playlist to mp3 downloader.<br></p>
